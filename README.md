# üî• Real-time Flame Intensity Classification using Machine Learning and IoT

This project combines **Machine Learning** and **IoT** to classify the **real-time intensity of kitchen flame** using a flame sensor connected to Arduino and deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

A **Decision Tree Classifier** is trained on labeled current readings from the flame sensor to identify four flame levels:
- **No Flame**
- **Low Flame**
- **Medium Flame**
- **High Flame**

The model is deployed on a Raspberry Pi which receives live sensor data from Arduino via serial communication and classifies the flame intensity in real-time.
